# Brief — yacht-maintenance-log-spreadsheet-template

> Hand-authored 2026-06-11. The spec Claude drafts against, then `gate.mjs`, then the founder gates `publish.mjs`.

## Target

- **Keyword:** `yacht maintenance log spreadsheet template`
- **Chapter:** `search`
- **Format:** Tier-A (NEW) — the pre-software "we live in Excel" buyer
- **Slug / URL:** `/blogs/yacht-maintenance-log-spreadsheet-template`
- **Canonical:** `https://celeste7.ai/blogs/yacht-maintenance-log-spreadsheet-template`
- **Angle:** "The Free Yacht Maintenance Log Template — and the day the spreadsheet breaks."
- **Search intent:** A chief engineer / ETO / superintendent searching for a free spreadsheet template to log maintenance. Give them a genuinely useful one. Then, honestly, show the day it stops scaling — and the restrained upgrade path. Restraint, not a pitch.

## Reader & promise

- **Persona:** Chief engineer / ETO on a smaller or owner-operated vessel, or a superintendent setting one up; pre-PMS, runs maintenance in Excel/Sheets.
- **Promise the title makes (must keep):** a real, copyable template structure they can build today — columns, tabs, conventions — that works, with no catch.
- **The honest turn:** name where a spreadsheet stops working (not "it's bad" — it's the right first tool). Lead with the LOSS: the column nobody fills, the file that forks, the knowledge that leaves with the laptop.

## SAFE claim phrasings available (search chapter — use verbatim or weaker)

- "Natural-language search across your vessel's records and manuals."
- "Type what you'd ask a colleague."
- "Search returns the record, not a snippet."
- "Finds what you mean, not what you typed."
- "Results are scoped to your vessel and role — no filter to set up first."
- "Results open the source record itself."
- "Runs alongside your existing PMS — nothing to replace, nothing to migrate." (cloud-based)
- "Your existing manuals, PDFs, scans, exports, and emails are indexed as they are. No reformatting exercises."
- "Your data is yours. Nothing is held hostage." (export commitment)
- Append-only / attributed-and-timestamped (ledger), as a single supporting line only — this is a search piece.

## Do NOT write (gate hard-fails)

- No AI / smart / ML / automate / seamless / optimize / magic / revolutionary / intelligent lexicon (editorial AI mention only with `data-editorial`).
- No "every domain cited" / "all 12/14 domains" / "writes itself" / "mapped to root cause" / "real-time" / "sub-second" / "sealed PDF" / "money-finder" / "cascade/propagate" / "knowledge graph".
- No pricing or $ / € / £ figures, no "per month" (CALL-ONLY).
- Host is `verifier.celeste7.ai`, never `verify.`.
- No invented statistics or fake counters. Industry numbers need a real named source with a link.
- No internal code/file names.

## Assets (respect NEVER lines)

- `{{asset:search-idle}}` — light-mode "Find anything…" bar over a needs-attention list. NEVER caption the list as "AI prioritisation" — it's a list of open items. Use for the search payoff moment.
- `{{asset:parts}}` — a part with physical location, stock vs minimum, OEM no., barcode, raise-PO. NEVER quote the in-image unit cost as pricing; don't headline "Recommended Minimum". Use for "the spreadsheet cell that should have been a record".
- `{{asset:certificate}}` — STCW cert, valid + renewal-due, survey window, holder doc list. Cert-expiry is a VITAMIN — one supporting line/visual only, never a headline.

## Required structure

- One `<h1>` = the angle title.
- `<header class="article-header">` with meta line + Apple-style lede (first sentence carries it).
- `<div class="article-body">`: problem → the actual template → where it breaks → what good looks like → one product moment (search-idle) → FAQ → summary → sources → CTA to `/#pilot`.
- accent-callout + stat-callout (stat only if a real sourced number) callouts.
- FAQ H2 + 3–4 H3 questions (drives FAQPage JSON-LD in meta.json).
- `<ul class="summary-list">` takeaways.
- `<div class="article-sources">` numbered, every external claim cited with a link.
- `<div class="article-cta">` ending at `/#pilot`.
- ~1100–1400 words.

## Internal links

- `/blogs/knowledge-crisis-superyachts` — crew turnover / knowledge loss (the loss anchor).
- `/blogs/natural-language-search-yacht` — search the records in plain language.
- `/blogs/audit-trail-superyacht` — append-only audit trail (one supporting link).
- `https://verifier.celeste7.ai` — proof payoff.
- `/#pilot` — conversion.
